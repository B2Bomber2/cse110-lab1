# Welcome to my page! 
**About myself** <br>
I am Ferrari, a second-year computer engineering student at UC San Diego. 

I like this quote:

-- Professor Powell

My favorite line of code that I wrote on a personal project is `serialcomm = serial.Serial(port.device, 9600, timeout=None, rtscts=True)`
You can find that repository [here](https://github.com/B1Bomber/binaryKeyboard)! It is on a personal Github account. 

## Here are some other stuff
**Some fun stuff to procrastinate on:**
1. item 2 is wrong
2. item 1 is wrong
3. none of the above are wrong
4. are all of the above are wrong?


**Same thing, but it is unordered. Swap the items around for some fun. ~~Totally not the same thing~~:**
- item 2 is wrong
- item 1 is wrong
- none of the above are wrong
- are all of the above are wrong?


**I am going back to work now:**
- [x] Finish CSE 110 Lab 1
- [ ] Do micro-soldering for ECE 196
- [ ] Do some computer aided design for personal project
- [x] Sleep...

**Still here? Are you bored? Here are some breaking news for you to occupy your time with:**
